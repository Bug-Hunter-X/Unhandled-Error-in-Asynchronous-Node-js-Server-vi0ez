This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js where an unhandled exception in an asynchronous callback crashes the server without providing helpful error messages.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.  The error occurs because an asynchronous operation throws an exception that is not caught, causing the process to terminate unexpectedly.  The solution implements a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors within the asynchronous operation, logging the error and sending an appropriate response to the client.  The importance of robust error handling in asynchronous Node.js applications is highlighted to ensure stability and informative error reporting.
